            25.7902-4(S-90)(1), (2), or (3), as applicable, to determine if an offeror meets the
            conditions for an exception to the requirement to verify DLA controlling authority
            approval to access export-controlled data.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="List2" class="List2 ">(1) If the offeror is a manufacturer or an OEM offering its
            manufactured item and does not require access to DLA controlled technical data or
            information to complete contract performance, the offeror must have asserted within its
            offer or must otherwise confirm in writing to the contracting officer prior to award
            that it does not require access to DLA controlled technical data or information, and it
            will provide items that conform to the current revision of applicable technical data.

            produced by another source of supply and does not require access to technical data or
            information to complete performance, the offeror must have asserted in its offer or must
            otherwise confirm in writing to the contracting officer prior to award that it does not
            require access to controlled technical data or information and that it is offering items
            that conform to the current revision of applicable technical data. The contracting

            solely because the offeror does not have DLA controlling authority approval to access
            export control technical data. The contracting officer shall not make blanket
            determinations to delay awards pending DLA controlling authority approval. The
            contracting officer shall review each procurement independently, document any decision
            to delay the award pending DLA controlling authority approval, and include the
            documentation in the contract file.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:outputclass="Normal" class="Normal ">(S-92) If the awardee confirmed prior to award that it did not
            require access to controlled technical data or information to perform and after award
            notifies the contracting officer that it does require access, the contracting officer
            shall not grant a delivery extension for the awardee to obtain DLA controlling authority
            approval to access export control technical data. For unilateral purchase orders, if an
            awardee states after award that it requires access to technical data or information, the
            contracting officer may withdraw the purchase order in accordance with FAR 13.004(c), as
            the awardee is unable to accept DLA’s offer through performance.</p></div></div></div></html>
