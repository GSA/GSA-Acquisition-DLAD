Upon making the determination to invoke PVT, contracting officers shall contact the product specialist to take the appropriate technical actions. The product specialist may also decide to invoke PVT and will contact the contracting officer with the appropriate justification.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" class="">The product specialist will issue a quality assurance letter of instruction (QALI) to DCMA when quality concerns relating to the item or the supplier are identified, with a copy of the QALI to the contracting officer for inclusion in Records Management. The QALI invokes the PVT requirement. DCMA will notify the contractor and initiate the testing process. When PVT is invoked, contracting officers use the authority under FAR 52.246-2, Inspection of Supplies-Fixed-Price.

If PVT is invoked at contract award, the contract will explicitly state this testing requirement and a QALI will be generated. If PVT is invoked after contract award, a QALI will be created and the DCMA quality assurance representative (QAR) will notify the contractor that testing will be performed.

The contractor and Government may agree to dispose of samples not destroyed when the cost of the item does not justify the shipping expense. Samples that pass testing and are not returned to the contractor will be considered part of the contract quantity for payment and delivery.
