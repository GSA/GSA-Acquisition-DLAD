EBS systems logic simultaneously accommodates service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) set-asides, HUBZone small business set-asides, and total small business set-asides, including exceptions and waivers to the non-manufacturers rule. If, at the time of solicitation, there is a reasonable expectation of receiving offers from two or more SDVOSBs or HUBZone small business concerns, the EBS software uses a combined set-aside for the automated solicitation.
