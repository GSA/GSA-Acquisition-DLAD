Participation in S&amp;S validation and testing will be at no additional expense to the Government, and does not justify an equitable adjustment to the contract price. The plan must include methodology, rating criteria, labor, materials, and time required to conduct validation and testing. S&amp;S validation generally entails verifying if the contractor and subcontractors have (a) sufficient equipment, facilities, personnel, stock, pre-positioned raw materials, production capabilities, and base resources; (b) agreements, networks, and plans for distribution (receiving, storing, packaging, and issuing); (c) transportation services to accommodate the S&amp;S requirements in the contract; (d) examination of any in-house work; (e) review of the stock rotation plan; and (f) other contracts that impact the production of added or accelerated delivery of contract quantities. The testing/verification plan is not required to be included in the offeror’s proposal. Offerors are encouraged to consider the possibility of the Government requesting this participation when formulating the proposal.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:id="GZtxGv" TCE:outputclass="Normal" class="GZtxGv Normal ">*****</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:id="cIVyPr" class="cIVyPr ">(b) Solicitations issued by DLA Aviation, DLA Land and Maritime, and DLA Troop Support Medical, Subsistence, Construction &amp; Equipment (C&amp;E), Clothing &amp; Textile (C&amp;T), and Industrial Hardware (IH) must include procurement note L18 when surge requirements apply.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:id="IhDIJZ" TCE:outputclass="Normal" class="IhDIJZ Normal ">*****</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:id="JVkBbE" TCE:outputclass="Normal" class="JVkBbE Normal ">L18 Surge and Sustainment (S&amp;S) Requirements – Instructions to Offerors (FEB 2017)</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:id="gCjeua" TCE:outputclass="Normal" class="gCjeua Normal ">(1) Each offeror must describe in its proposal its ability to meet the S&amp;S accelerated delivery specified for items critical to support the Department of Defense in conducting contingency operations.
