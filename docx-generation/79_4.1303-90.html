The request for a waiver must be approved by the Commander/Director or Deputy Commander/Director of the site. The cognizant DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office reserves the right to determine whether a waiver request will be forwarded for processing.

Violations of local AIS security policy, such as password sharing, performing personal work, file access violations, or browsing files outside the scope of the contract, will result in removal of the contractor employee from Government property and referral to the contractor for appropriate disciplinary action. Actions taken by the contractor in response to a violation will be evaluated and will be reflected in the contractorâ€™s performance assessment for use in making future source selection decisions. In addition, based on the nature and extent of any violations of AIS security policy, the Government will consider whether it needs to pursue any other actions under the contract such as a possible termination.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" class="">(l) The contractor may also be required to obtain a Common Access Card (CAC) orInstallation Access Badge for each contractor employee in accordance with procedures established by DLA.

Additionally, the contractor shall notify the contracting officer immediately in writing whenever a contractor employee working on this contract resigns, is reassigned, is terminated, or no longer requires admittance to the Federally-controlled facility or access to Federally-controlled information systems. When the contractor employee departs, the contractor will relay departure information to the cognizant DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office and the Trusted Agent (TA) that entered the individual into the Trusted Associated Sponsorship System (TASS), so appropriate databases can be updated. The contractor will ensure each departed employee has completed the DLA J6 Out-Processing Checklist, when applicable, for the necessary security briefing, has returned any Government furnished equipment, returned the DoD CAC and DLA (or equivalent Installation) badge, returned any DoD or DLA vehicle decal, and requested deletion of local area network account with a prepared Department of Defense (DD) Form 2875.
