The request for a waiver must be approved by the Commander/Director or Deputy Commander/Director of the site.

Actions taken by the contractor in response to a violation will be evaluated and will be reflected in the contractor’s performance assessment for use in making future source selection decisions. In addition, based on the nature and extent of any violations of AIS security policy, the Government will consider whether it needs to pursue any other actions under the contract such as a possible termination.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" class="">(l) The contractor may also be required to obtain a Common Access Card (CAC) orInstallation Access Badge for each contractor employee in accordance with procedures established by DLA.

When the contractor employee departs, the contractor will relay departure information to the cognizant DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office and the Trusted Agent (TA) that entered the individual into the Trusted Associated Sponsorship System (TASS), so appropriate databases can be updated. The contractor will ensure each departed employee has completed the DLA J6 Out-Processing Checklist, when applicable, for the necessary security briefing, has returned any Government furnished equipment, returned the DoD CAC and DLA (or equivalent Installation) badge, returned any DoD or DLA vehicle decal, and requested deletion of local area network account with a prepared Department of Defense (DD) Form 2875.
