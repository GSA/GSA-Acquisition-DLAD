      <p id="hht345">(a) Offers for part numbered items may be other than exactly stated in the PID due to a
            variety of reasons such as administrative changes, engineering changes, reverse
            engineering, obsolescence or manufacturing enhancements. Contracting officers shall
            coordinate with product specialists for the review of an offer other than exact product.
            The product specialist will update the Material Master in accordance with any change to
            part number. Solicitations and contracts shall include procurement note C01 when
            procuring part-numbered items.</p>

            evaluation shall cite the national stock number (NSN) of the exact product and include
            the applicable level of technical data. The level of technical data that the Government
            has available for use to evaluate the acceptability of an alternate product offered, and
            the corresponding level of technical data that must be furnished with an offer of
