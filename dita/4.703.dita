            delivery, and shall retain documented evidence (supply chain traceability
            documentation), as described in paragraph (2) of this procurement note, demonstrating
            the item is from the approved manufacturer and conforms to the technical requirements. </p>

            number, manufacturing source, manufacturing sourceâ€™s Commercial and Government Entity
            (CAGE) code, and clear identification of the name and location of all supply chain
            intermediaries between the manufacturer to the contractor to item(s) acceptance by the
            Government. The documentation should also include, if available, the manufacturer's

            unacceptable, the contracting officer may take corrective action, including, but not
            limited to, cancellation of undelivered orders or rejection of delivered supplies. </p>
