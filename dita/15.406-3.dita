      <p id="p_P15_406_3_a">(a)(11) “Price reasonableness codes” (PRCs) are two-position codes in EBS. The first position identifies the support, if any, the contracting officer received. The second position identifies the price analysis technique, and cost analysis if performed. Contracting officers shall ensure the appropriate PRC is entered in EBS and provided in the SAAD, or PNM, as applicable.</p>
