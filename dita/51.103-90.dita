   <conbody>
      <p>When contractor use of a DLA-managed supply source is determined to be the best value, considering price, delivery and other factors, the contracting officer shall include contract language to hold the contractor responsible to meet the delivery requirements whether or not Government supply sources are used. Failure to meet the contract delivery requirements is a contractor-caused delay.</p>
