The administrative cost for contract modifications issued by DLA Troop Support Construction and Equipment, Clothing and Textile, Subsistence, and Medical is $750. These fees are in addition to consideration cost (see 43.102(b)(S-91)); and costs for Government reinspection or retest, if necessary.</p><p outputclass="List2">(S-91) <i>Consideration cost. </i>The contracting officer determines the most appropriate calculation method. The formula below is provided as a potential method for calculating consideration for issuing the modification.</p><p outputclass="Normal">Formula: (((((E-1)/(E+1))+1)/100)*M*V) + D</p><p outputclass="Normal">Key: E = # of Extensions: The number of extension request instances that contractor asks for at the time of the modification (i.e., 1 for 1st request, 2 for 2nd request, and 10 for 10th request).</p><p outputclass="Normal">M = Lateness (expressed in months): The number of months the contractor has requested an extension. For example, if the contractor requests an extension of 30 days for the “current” delivery time, M would be 1. For 120 days, M would be 4. If this is the contractor’s second request, and they want another 120 days, M would still be 4.</p><p outputclass="Normal">V = Value of Extended Portion of Contract: The value of the material that is going to be delayed. If the total contract dollar value is for $50K and the whole contract is going to be late, V would be $50K. If the contractor is going to deliver half of the contract on time but needs more time on the other half, then V would be $25K.</p><p outputclass="Normal">D = Direct Cost: Fixed costs associated with writing the modification, re-inspecting material, and any other cost the Government incurs for making the change ($250 as the base).</p><p outputclass="Normal">Examples:</p><p outputclass="Normal">1. Contract is for $1.5M contractor needs a 30 day extension:(((((1-1)/(1+1))+1)/100)*1*1,500,000)+250 = $15,250</p><p outputclass="Normal">2. Same contract, but now they need an additional 90 days:(((((2-1)/(2+1))+1)/100)*3*1,500,000)+250 = $60,250.00</p><p outputclass="Normal">3. Same contract, they have delivered half of their order, but they need 120 days to finish: (((((3-1)/(3+1))+1)/100)*4*750,000)+250 = $45,250</p></conbody></concept>
