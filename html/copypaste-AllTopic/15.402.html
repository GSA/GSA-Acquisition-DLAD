        <p class="p">(a)(3) When using a market basket or similar solicitation evaluation, contracting
            officers shall use one of the pricing models below. Ensure the items selected for the
            market basket represent the scope, extent, and complexity of the acquisition and all
            cost drivers. Cost drivers are high dollar value, high purchase frequency, and high
            volume items forecast for procurement. The contracting officer decides the cost driver
            population by analyzing historical demand data, expected future demand, and other
            relevant data. Final market baskets must represent the various types of items in the
            solicitation and advise the contracting officer of the expected cost to the Government.
            Post-award pricing strategies shall ensure fair and reasonable prices paid for all items
            purchased under the contract. The pricing strategy shall address how new items added to
            the contract and price changes to existing items under the contract will be determined
            fair and reasonable. See Subpart <a class="xref 17.95" href="SUBPART_17.95.html">SUBPART 17.95</a> when
