            May 15, 2023. FDT applies to solicitations and contracts issued by DLA Aviation, DLA
            Land and Maritime, and DLA Troop Support, unless one of the exclusions in <a class="xref" href="47.305-3-90.html#DLAD_47_305-3-90">

            transportation processes, controls, and costs, when evaluated, are in the best interest
