      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_9_306__ZvNiBJ">(1) If there is not a separate contract line item number (CLIN) for FAT, the offeror shall include all costs and risk associated with completion of the FAT requirement in the production CLIN price.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_9_306__SAczve">(2) If there is a separate FAT CLIN, the offeror shall include all costs and risk associated with completion of the FAT requirement in the FAT CLIN price. The unit of issue for the FAT CLIN, EACH, is equal to one First Article Test (1EA=1FAT). To receive payment for any costs associated with FAT, the offeror shall propose costs associated with FAT on a separate CLIN. The offeror shall base the production CLIN price solely on all costs associated with completion of the production units and shall exclude all FAT-related costs.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_9_306__drvCRB">(3) The contracting officer will use the total award price in selecting the best value offer from among all eligible offerors. However, for an offeror to be eligible for award, the contracting officer must determine that the FAT CLIN price (unless FAT is waived) and the production CLIN price are fair and reasonable; and, if set-aside under FAR Part 19, a fair market price. The offeror shall not propose a FAT CLIN price that is materially unbalanced in relation to the production CLIN price. In the event an offeror receives a waiver of the FAT requirement, the contracting officer will deduct the FAT CLIN price for the waived source in determining the total award price.</p>

The contractor shall bear the costs of the additional first article testing resulting from any of the causes in paragraphs (4)(a)(i)-(iii) instituted by the contractor and not due to changes directed by the Government.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_9_306__ImJweq">(5) Waivers. The offeror may submit a request for FAT waiver to the contracting officer, who may waive the FAT requirement when all of the following criteria apply:</p>

If the item previously furnished is similar but not identical to the item being acquired under the current buy, the offeror shall explain why manufacture of the item previously furnished is sufficient to demonstrate its ability to manufacture the item being acquired under the current buy without need for a first article test.</p>
      <p class="p List3" id="DLAD_9_306__zysnmu">(iii) Engineering control document/change number of item previously furnished.</p>
