      <p class="p List3">(ii) The DLA Acquisition Director shall review the report and determine whether to support the formal appeal or accept the COC. The DLA Acquisition Compliance, Policy and Pricing Division shall advise the contracting officer of the DLA Acquisition Director’s decision within 5 working days and provide a copy of the decision to the Small Business Programs Director.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iii) If the DLA Acquisition Director supports the contracting officer’s intent to appeal, the DLA Acquisition Compliance, Policy and Pricing Division will advise the contracting officer to forward the formal appeal to the departmental director of the Office of Small Business Programs (reference DFARS PGI 219.602-3) within 5 working days and simultaneously provide a copy to the DLA Acquisition Director.
