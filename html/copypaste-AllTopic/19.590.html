      <p class="p List1">(a) The Defense Logistics Agency’s systems logic for automated simplified procurements considers the applicability of more than one type of set-aside using a cascading evaluation of offers (see DFARS 215.203-70). </p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) If the nonmanufacturer rule is waived (see FAR 19.505(c)(4)) and eligible offers are not received for a service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) set-aside or a HUBZone set-aside, the automated system will cascade to a small business set-aside. </p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) If the nonmanufacturer rule is waived and after cascading a SDVOSB set-aside or a HUBZone set-aside, no eligible offer is received from a small business concern at a fair market price, the automated systems will withdraw the set-aside and automatically resolicit on an unrestricted basis. </p>
      <p class="p List2">(3) If no eligible offers are received on a SDVOSB set-aside or a HUBZone set-aside and the nonmanufacturer rule is not waived, the automated system will cancel the solicitation and resolicit as a small business set-aside.. </p>
      <p class="p List1">(b) Use procurement note L17 for automated solicitations valued over the micro-purchase threshold but less than or equal to the SAT when the nonmanufacturer rule (NMR) is waived and a set-aside to a service disabled veteran-owned small business concern is anticipated. </p>
