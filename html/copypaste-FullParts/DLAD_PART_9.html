      <p class="p Normal">The Defense Contractor Review List (DCRL) is an enterprise-wide tool for use by contracting officers to identify and communicate contractor performance, capability, and integrity issues for making determinations of responsibility and the effective administration of contracts. The DCRL has Special Attention Reason Codes that describe the basis for being on the list and Treatment Codes that provide recommended actions to contracting officers for mitigating risk. The DCRL includes contractors identified in SAM as debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or otherwise ineligible for award. SAM data takes precedence over DCRL data.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">(a) The BDA dashboard is a decision support capability tool. It is available for use on an optional basis by contracting officers, acquisition specialists, product specialists, fraud counsel, and other personnel involved in the acquisition process. It identifies potential item, price, and supplier risk areas prior to award and recommends mitigation strategies to minimize these risks. It consolidates data from multiple sources (e.g., DUN and Bradstreet, Supplier Performance Risk System SPRS (formally PPIRS-SR NG), SAM, etc.) into one dashboard.</p>
      <p class="p">(b) Using the BDA dashboard does not reduce the contracting officer’s authorities or responsibilities. For example, contracting officers shall not (1) use BDA data as the sole basis for making determinations of responsibility or price reasonableness; or (2) use supplier risk data in place of the SPRS Delivery Score and Quality Classification. When evaluating acquisition risk, contracting officers should consider using the BDA dashboard as an additional source of information to help mitigate risks of suspect suppliers, potential overpayment, and procuring counterfeit and/or non-conforming spare parts. In the event of any data inconsistencies, the originating data source takes precedence over BDA data.</p>
      <p class="p">(c) Conditions when contracting officers should consider using the BDA dashboard include, but are not limited to—</p>

        <p class="p" id="DLAD_9_270-3__hg48jd">(a) The product specialist (PS) shall coordinate with the design control
            activity and update the material master, ensuring the approved sources are current.
            Prior procurement history is not an indication of current source approval. The PS shall
            advise the contracting officer of changes to a supplier’s status. When the PS removes an
            approved source, the PS shall identify all open purchase requests and open contracts and
            notify the assigned contracting officers and contract administrators. Contracting
            officers shall amend solicitations to reflect the updated approved sources. If a
            contract action will result in delivery of an item from a source that is no longer
            approved, the contracting officer or contract administrator shall coordinate with the
            product specialist to determine if the ESA will accept the material. In the event the
            ESA will not accept the material, the contract action shall be terminated. The PS shall
            draft a letter with the rationale for removal for the contracting officer. The
            contracting officer shall coordinate with the COMPAD and issue the letter to the
            supplier.</p>
        <p class="p Normal">Origin inspection is required. Certificate of conformance (COC) is
            not authorized, unless approved by the ESA. Incorporate all quality requirements into
            the contract when specified (e.g., first article test, production lot testing). Do not
            waive any quality requirement without referring to the PS.</p>
        <p class="p Normal">When automated solicitations are used to solicit CSIs, offers must
            be manually evaluated and awarded.</p>
        <p class="p Normal">All solicitations and contracts for CSI shall list the items in
            DFARS 252.209-7010 and shall include procurement note H04.</p>

        <p class="p Normal">H04 Sourcing for Critical Safety Items (SEP 2016)</p>
        <p class="p Normal">The contractor procuring, modifying, repairing, or overhauling a
            critical safety item shall only use a source approved by the head of the design control
            activity.</p>
        <p class="p Normal">*****</p>
        <p class="p Normal">When multiple approved sources are identified, consider using
            acquisition strategies to help maintain more than one source, such as split awards or
            multiple awards. This minimizes ESA revalidation referrals required for CSIs whenever a
            source has not received an award for over 3 years.</p>
        <p class="p Normal">Refer all offers of used, reconditioned, or remanufactured supplies;
            or unused former Government surplus property that are under consideration to the product
            specialist for evaluation (see <a class="xref" href="DLAD_PART_11.html#DLAD_11_302__ereD3r">
            <u class="ph u">11.302(b)</u>11.302 Policy.</a>).</p>
        <p class="p Normal">Prior to making award, obtain all approvals required on the DLA Form
            13, Critical Safety Items and SPC Items Award Checklist, and retain in official contract
            file.</p>
        <p class="p Normal">When award is made, notify the PS, who will determine if a quality
            assurance letter of instruction (QALI) is required. If award was made to a dealer or
            distributor, a QALI is mandatory; the QAS must have conducted a preaward review of
            traceability documentation in accordance with the approval/review requirements at <a class="xref" href="#DLAD_9_270-3">

            <u class="ph u">(S-91)</u>9.270-3 Policy.</a>.</p>
        <p class="p Normal">When a contractor changes a business arrangement with an approved
            source for the item being acquired, or in a manufacturing process or facility, the
            contracting officer shall coordinate with the PS and take corrective action as
            needed.</p>
        <p class="p Normal">(S-90) Critical Application Items (CAIs) are items where failure
            could affect mission, performance, readiness, or safety. The PS may need to coordinate
            with the ESA and shall follow any applicable performance based agreement and DLAI
            3200.4.</p>
        <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_9_270-3__p_P9_270_3_S_91">(S-91) Contracting officers shall use the table

            prospective contractor is technically acceptable.</p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_9_306__ZvNiBJ">(1) If there is not a separate contract line item number (CLIN) for FAT, the offeror shall include all costs and risk associated with completion of the FAT requirement in the production CLIN price.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_9_306__SAczve">(2) If there is a separate FAT CLIN, the offeror shall include all costs and risk associated with completion of the FAT requirement in the FAT CLIN price. The unit of issue for the FAT CLIN, EACH, is equal to one First Article Test (1EA=1FAT). To receive payment for any costs associated with FAT, the offeror shall propose costs associated with FAT on a separate CLIN. The offeror shall base the production CLIN price solely on all costs associated with completion of the production units and shall exclude all FAT-related costs.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_9_306__drvCRB">(3) The contracting officer will use the total award price in selecting the best value offer from among all eligible offerors. However, for an offeror to be eligible for award, the contracting officer must determine that the FAT CLIN price (unless FAT is waived) and the production CLIN price are fair and reasonable; and, if set-aside under FAR Part 19, a fair market price. The offeror shall not propose a FAT CLIN price that is materially unbalanced in relation to the production CLIN price. In the event an offeror receives a waiver of the FAT requirement, the contracting officer will deduct the FAT CLIN price for the waived source in determining the total award price.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">9.406-90</span> Procedures for debarments based on poor performance.</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">(a) Policy. Where poor performance is to be relied upon as a basis for debarment, the responsibility for ensuring that action is taken to initiate debarment proceedings lies primarily with the contracting officer.</p>
      <p class="p">(b) Referral. In accordance with the procedures contained in subparagraph (c) below, the contracting officer will refer to Office of Counsel those instances of contractor nonperformance that are so serious as to justify consideration of possible debarment action.</p>
      <p class="p">(c) Decision-making process.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) Before referring a contractor to the Office of Counsel for possible preparation of a debarment report, the contracting officer must be able to document the poor performance which will form the basis for a debarment recommendation. The contracting officer must also be able to demonstrate why debarment is appropriate under the circumstances, including any mitigating information known to the contracting officer. Referrals to the Office of Counsel should include all current information necessary to support the business decision that is to be recommended to the SACI. The contracting officer should be prepared to update the information provided once the debarment process is underway and to participate with Office of Counsel in presenting the case to the SACI.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) When recommending a contractor to Office of Counsel for consideration of a possible debarment recommendation on the basis of poor performance, provide:</p>
      <p class="p List3">(i) A clear identification of the contractor, including divisions, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and contractor employees, officers, and directors, specifically identifying the contractor personnel who have participated in the Government contracting process.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii) A detailed account of the contractor’s current active contracts, recent, relevant performance history, and history of performance problems prompting the referral. While this detailed accounting of contracting performance will necessarily focus on contracts awarded by DLA, performance on other Government contracts must also be addressed. In this connection, the assigned contract administration office should be asked to provide information, as well as comments, on the action being considered.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iii) The reasons identified for the contractor’s poor performance and the action taken by the Government to protect its business interests.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iv) A discussion of whether a debarment action directed toward a specific division, organizational element, or commodity would adequately protect the Government’s interests.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(v) A discussion of the period of debarment to be recommended to the SACI, supported by rationale that addresses the likelihood that the contractor will be able to take corrective actions necessary to successfully perform in the future.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(vi) When a report recommending debarment is forwarded to General Counsel, provide notice of this action to contracting personnel at the recommending procuring organization assigned to commodities for which solicitations are likely to result in offers from the contractor identified in the report and to other procuring organizations.</p>
