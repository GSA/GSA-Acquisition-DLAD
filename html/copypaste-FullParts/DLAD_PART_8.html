      <p class="p">DCSO is responsible for acquiring audit readiness and/or audit sustainment services for
            DLA organizations. No other procuring organization shall award a contract or place an
            order on an existing contract for audit readiness and/or audit sustainment services for
            a DLA organization without the written approval of the DCSO Director. In addition, no
            DLA requirements owner shall submit a requirement for audit readiness and/or audit
            sustainment services for a DLA organization to a non-DLA contracting organization (e.g.,
            an order under the Economy Act, as provided under FAR 17.502-2) without the written
            approval of the DCSO Director.</p>
      <p class="p">(S-91) DCSO is the single DLA procuring organization with authority to procure office
            document devices and associated maintenance support (see <a class="xref" href="DLAD_PART_39.html#DLAD_39_9001__Eerer23">
            <u class="ph u">39.9001</u>

      <p class="p">(S-92) DCSO is the primary procuring organization responsible for acquiring information
            technology (IT) services, supplies, equipment, training, and subscriptions for DLA (see
            <a class="xref" href="DLAD_PART_39.html#DLAD_39_9001__rer433">

         </a>(c)).</p>
      <p class="p">(S-93) Procurement of training.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) Pursuant to Director, DLA Human Resources memorandum entitled,
            “Centralizing Administration of Government Purchase Cards for Training Payment,” dated
            June 30, 2014, DLA organizations shall submit all training requirements, regardless of
            the training source or funding source, to DLA Human Resources Services, DLA Training
            (DHRS-DT) for review, management, administration, and sourcing. If DHRS-DT determines
            the training requirement is valid, DHRS-DT will then determine the best method to source
            that training (e.g., LMS Online course, Resident Course with DLA trainers, DAU Course,
            GPC, new contract, etc.).</p>
      <p class="p List2" id="DLAD_8_003__p_P8_003_S93_2">(2) DCSO Columbus is the DLA Center of Excellence
            for DLA Enterprise Training Services. If DHRS-DT determines a new contract is the best
            method to satisfy the training requirement, DHRS-DT will work with the requiring
            activity to prepare a requirements package and submit the request for contract support
            to DCSO Columbus in coordination with the requiring activity, unless <a class="xref" href="#DLAD_8_003__p_P8_003_S93_3">

      <p class="p List2" id="DLAD_8_003__p_P8_003_S93_3">(3) DLA organizations shall not submit requirements for training
            services to any procuring organization other than DCSO unless DHRS-DT determines in
            writing that a non-DCSO procuring organization should provide the contracting support
            and the DCSO Director approves the determination in writing.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">8.703-90</span> Policy for additions of AbilityOne products to the procurement list.</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">(a) The 1971 Supply Management Relationship Agreement between DoD and GSA gives DoD authority to buy assigned items for the Federal Government. DoD assigned this authority to DLA.</p>
      <p class="p">(b) DLA works with AbilityOne to add DLA-managed and bought items to its procurement list.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) Refer to the <a class="xref" href="https://www.abilityone.gov/procurement_list/services_commodity.html" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">AbilityOne Procurement List</u>
         </a> (<a class="xref" href="https://www.abilityone.gov/procurement_list/services_commodity.html" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">https://www.abilityone.gov/procurement_list/services_commodity.html</u>
         </a>) for general guidance</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) When adding NSNs managed by DLA to the list, the AbilityOne liaison works with the contracting officer and the Small Business Office to gain approval. All parties must consider requirements, pricing, costs, drawings and specifications, and proposed delivery schedules. The contracting officer signs the price concurrence letter, AbilityOne form CBSD 1005, when receiving an agreeable price proposal. The contracting officer must complete the actions within 30 days.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(3) AbilityOne must send a business case analysis with supporting documents to the contracting officer and the Small Business Office when adding managed or procured items assigned to DLA for Total Government Requirement (TGR) or a Broad Government Requirement (BGR).</p>
      <p class="p List3">(i) Central Nonprofit Agency (CNA), NIB, or Source America sends the BCA to the Small Business Office AbilityOne liaison to begin the review. The Small Business Office verifies the NSN and contacts the NSN owner. When the material does not match an NSN, DLA cannot create a new NSN.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii) The procuring organization shall name a contracting officer to review the BCA and evaluate the AbilityOne request. The contracting officer must have responsibility for the DLA item proposed for addition. The contracting officer must:</p>
      <p class="p List4">(A) Review the BCA and supporting documents.</p>
      <p class="p List4">(B) Conduct a market comparison to document price reasonableness. The contracting officer must find the price fair and reasonable. DLA does not expect AbilityOne to offer the lowest price or to offer prices matching out-of-date prices, loss leaders, salvage prices, or sale prices, especially when using raw materials that have high market volatility. AbilityOne pricing is based on free on board (f.o.b.) origin.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(4) When the BCA adequately identifies a need, the contracting officer should consider sponsorship regardless of demand history.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i"> </em>(i) When considering adding an NSN to the AbilityOne list, the contracting officer reviews for long-term contract coverage. If a long-term contract exists for the item, the contracting officer may base price reasonableness on comparison with the current contract price.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii) When comparing the proposed fair market price (FMP) to an f.o.b. destination contract price, the contracting officer should add the estimated freight to the proposed FMP for an accurate comparison.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iii) When that cost is unreasonably higher than the current DLA f.o.b. destination contract price, the contracting officer documents the addition as not in the Government’s best interest. The contracting officer tells the AbilityOne liaison the decision. The CNA may either propose a lower price or withdraw the BCA.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(5) If the contracting officer agrees with the proposed addition, the contracting officer shall sign and electronically send AbilityOne Form CBSD 1005 to the AbilityOne liaison. Include the BCA number for the proposal. Contracting officers shall make their best efforts to complete these actions within 30 days. The AbilityOne liaison sends the addition information to the CNA.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(6) The CNA confirms receipt and tells AbilityOne it is ready for production. The contracting officer decides the suitable contracting vehicle for the item. The contracting officer should consider the Government-wide nature of the procurement list and ensure item availability to all Federal agencies. </p>
      <p class="p List3">(i) For NSNs on long-term contract or BPA, the contracting officer shall confirm when the current option period expires.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii) DLA may add NSNs to AbilityOne agreements after receipt of the addition notice and the CNA ready letter.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iii) DLA cannot add NSNs on requirements contracts to AbilityOne agreements until after the current option period expires.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(iv) For NSNs on a prime vendor contract, the contracting officer decides whether to have the prime vendor buy the product from AbilityOne or remove the NSN from the contract. If the prime vendor removes the item from contract, then DLA can add it to an AbilityOne agreement.</p>
