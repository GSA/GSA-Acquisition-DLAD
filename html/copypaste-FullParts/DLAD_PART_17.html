      <p class="p">(a) DoD policy requires DoD warranted contracting officer review of all non-Economy Act orders over $500,000. DLA policy requires that a DLA warranted contracting officer review the assisted acquisition from a non-DoD entity of either supplies or services valued over the SAT. This review must be accomplished prior to sending the order to the funds certifier or issuing the military inter-departmental purchase request (MIPR) to the non-DoD activity. If the requesting official is different from the contracting officer, the requesting official must also review the acquisition package to ensure compliance with FAR, and DFARS. Contracting officers must not split requirements into smaller amounts in order to avoid contracting officer review.</p>

      <p class="p">(a) The DLA contracting officer must ensure, in both assisted and direct acquisitions<strong class="ph b">,</strong> that the requesting official has established a satisfactory quality surveillance plan for non-Economy Act orders in excess of $100,000 to facilitate the oversight of the goods provided or services performed by the performing agency. If DLA is making a direct or assisted acquisition on behalf of a customer activity, the DLA contracting officer must ensure that the requestor produces this plan. The plan must include:</p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) Contract administration oversight in accordance with the surveillance plan;</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) A process for receipt and review of receiving reports and invoices from the performing agency/contractor;</p>
      <p class="p List2">(3) Reconciliation of receiving reports and invoices; and</p>
      <p class="p List2">(4) Requirements for documenting acceptance of the goods received or services performed.</p>
      <p class="p">(b) The requesting official (i.e. the customer or program manager, with the assistance of the DLA contracting officer or post-award contracting official, as appropriate) must—</p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) Monitor balances with the performing agency;</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) Conduct tri-annual reviews of non-Economy Act orders in accordance with the Financial Management Regulation, Volume 3, Chapter 8, Section 0804, “Tri-Annual Review of Commitments and Obligations,” in conjunction with the Financial Management/J8 organization;</p>
      <p class="p List2">(3) Confirm open balances with the performing agency;</p>
      <p class="p List2">(4) Coordinate the return of funds from the non-DOD performing agency; and</p>
      <p class="p List2">(5) Coordinate with the accounting office to ensure timely deobligation of funds.</p>
      <p class="p">(c) In assisted acquisitions, payment must be made promptly upon the written request or billing of the performing agency/contractor. In assisted acquisitions and under specific conditions, payment to the performing agency may be made in advance or upon delivery of the supplies or services ordered, and must be for any part of the estimated or actual cost, as determined by the performing agency.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) The requesting official and supporting DLA contracting or program office must be cognizant of the performing agency’s payment method. Should the performing agency elect to receive advances or conduct advance billing prior to providing goods or services, the requesting official and/or DLA contracting or program office, as appropriate, must comply with the requirements pertaining to advances of public money outlined in Volume 4, Chapter 5 of the “DOD Financial Management Regulation,” which implements the general prohibition against advance payments contained in 31 U.S.C. 3324 and 10 U.S.C. 2307. When the conditions under which the advance was made are satisfied, the specific appropriation or law authorizing the advance must be cited on the order, and any unused amounts of the advance must be collected from the performing agency immediately and returned to the fund from which originally made.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) Payments made for services rendered or supplies furnished may be credited to the appropriation or fund of the agency performing the reimbursable work.</p>
      <p class="p">(d) All non-Economy Act orders must be reviewed by the requesting official to determine if they are complete. Completed orders must be fiscally closed out. The requesting official (or DLA contracting or program office, as appropriate) must reconcile funds and coordinate the return of excess or expired funds held by the performing agency. This review must include:</p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) Determination and identification, if applicable, of any outstanding invoices;</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) Determination and identification of existence of excess or expired funds;</p>
      <p class="p List2">(3) Coordination of return of funds from the non-DOD performing agency; and</p>
      <p class="p List2">(4) Coordination with the accounting office to ensure the deobligation of funds.</p>

      <p class="p">(a) A reopener requirement creates a right for an equitable adjustment in the contract price at a specified time or due to the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event or contingency of the type specified in FAR 31.205-7(c)(2).</p>
      <p class="p">(b) A reopener requirement provides a means of achieving an equitable resolution of the treatment of a significant contingent cost during both the initial pricing of a contract as well as at any time an equitable adjustment to such price is called for under the provisions of the requirement. Its use requires care to avoid a shift in risk from the contractor to the Government.  It should be used only in extraordinary circumstances involving high dollar value procurements and rarely less than the TINA threshold where the uncertainty associated with particular cost element(s) substantially impacts the contract price.</p>
      <p class="p">(c) Circumstances in which its use may be appropriate include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) A forward pricing rate agreement (FPRA) or forward pricing rate recommendation (FPRR) is not achievable, because of uncertainties having a significant impact such as:</p>
      <p class="p List3">(i) Supporting contractor budgetary data was not submitted;</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii) A substantial portion of the business base has not yet materialized; or,</p>

      <p class="p List2">(1) Ask the ACO to provide a recommended reopener requirement, if applicable.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) Query CBAR and the ACO, regarding the adequacy of the contractor’s accounting system to provide all necessary cost data in the form required to price adjustments. (Obtain a review of the adequacy of the accounting system if necessary.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(3) Obtain cost or pricing data applicable to the cost element and markup factors, to establish the base level from which adjustment will be made.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(4) Prepare proposed schedule for each affected CLIN, which identifies each specific rate, factor, element of cost, profit, etc., to be covered by the reopener requirement; and explicitly describes or provides an example of the precise methodology to be used to calculate any resulting price adjustment. Consider whether it is appropriate to retroactively apply a price, as subsequently finalized, to items already delivered on time and to late deliveries.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(5) If the reopener provides for an upward adjustment, advise the budget office to commit funds over and above the contract price to the amount of the ceiling established. If the award is funded by a Military Inter-Departmental Purchase Request, obtain confirmation from the requiring activity that funds have been set aside to cover the potential increase.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(6) Obtain HCA approval of the reopener requirement prior to conclusion of negotiations. The approval includes basis and limitations for use.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(7) Incorporate amounts and methods reached through preaward discussions or negotiations with the contractor in a document executed by both parties and attached to the PNM; or incorporate calculations supporting the contracting officer’s interpretation of negotiations in the PNM. Ensure confidential contractor information is not included in the contract.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(8) Indicate in a contract administration delegation letter if the award contains a reopener requirement.

      <p class="p List2">(2) If the nature of the contingency is such that its price impact can only be anticipated to fall within a broad range of prices instead of one or several alternative price outcomes, identify the range within which the amount for that cost element may be revised through negotiations; or</p>
      <p class="p List2">(3) If the contingency is such that its price impact cannot be anticipated to fall within a broad range, or the original price negotiations did not involve cost or pricing data, the reopener may specify that the parties will enter into good faith negotiations and include an option for terminating performance within a specified number of days following receipt of written notice by either party in the event of a failure to agree.</p>
      <p class="p">(f) A provision for a downward or upward adjustment as appropriate. An exception is authorized only when necessary to achieve final agreement on price. For contracts allowing an upward adjustment above the contract price, establish a firm, not-to-exceed ceiling, on an aggregate basis (and per unit basis if applicable), above which no price adjustment must be made.</p>
      <p class="p">(g) The method of adjusting any option quantity or period prices, if any, which may result from operation of the reopener.</p>

      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i">“D1-D6 schedule”</em> means surge requirements expressed in exact quantities with a 6-month sustainable accelerated delivery. The D1-D6 schedule is determined and obtained by using the support planning integrated data enterprise readiness system (SPIDERS) or industrial base management system (IBMS), or consulting the industrial specialist. The D1-D6 schedule is used when the monthly wartime rate (MWR) cannot be applied.  D1-D6 identifies the surge requirement, including the Services’ go-to-war requirements.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i">“Industrial capability issue (ICI)” </em>means a procurement issue created by the lack of industrial capability, capacity, and/or raw or semi-finished materials with lead-time issues that impact the ability of the supplier to deliver at the wartime rate. Mitigation of the issue requires an investment by the Government to improve capability to deliver at the wartime rate.  These investments are funded through the Warstopper program (refer to DLA Instruction 5025.03, Industrial Capabilities Program – Manage the Warstopper Program).</p>
      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i">“Industrial specialist”</em> means a Government employee within the industrial preparedness branch for DLA Aviation, the industrial support office for DLA Land and Maritime, the industrial base planning office in DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles (C&amp;T), the industrial preparedness branch in DLA Troop Support Construction and Equipment (C&amp;E), the strategic material sourcing group (SMSG) readiness division for DLA Troop Support Medical, and the industrial base planning branch for DLA Troop Support Subsistence who performs certain technical functions within their respective procuring organizations.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i">“Monthly wartime rate (MWR)”</em> means the combined recurring requirements for all services after offsets for peacetime DLA direct (DD) procuring organization surge capability or DLA managed war reserve material (WRM) stocks are applied. MWR is a forecast of additional monthly demand during wartime and is expressed in units per month. MWR is used for items with National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and can be found in the industrial base management system (IBMS) or by consulting the supply chain industrial specialist.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i">“Peacetime support issue” </em>means a situation when DLA is unable to meet the customer’s required delivery date for a weapon system repair part that is coded not mission capable-supply (NMCS), is a critical item that impacts mission capability (MICAP) or prevents the loss of life/property, or cannot be satisfied by routine fulfillment/replenishment procedures.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i">“Surge and sustainment (S&amp;S)” </em>means increased quantities and accelerated delivery rates required to meet Military Service requisitions across a broad spectrum of contingencies. The increased quantity and accelerated delivery rate are above and beyond the normal peacetime requirements, and are identified as MWR, D1-D6 schedule, or a surge quantity event.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i">“Surge and sustainment coverage” </em>means a combination of DLA’s ability to fill contingency requisitions through the MWR, D1-D6 schedule, or surge quantity option within the customer’s required delivery date (RDD) and the supplier’s ability to meet surge quantity and sustainable accelerated delivery.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i">“S&amp;S event” </em>means the relationship between the S&amp;S planning requirement (SSPR), the S&amp;S actual requirements, and S&amp;S coverage. DLA Manual 5025.12, Industrial Capability Program – Surge and Sustainment (S&amp;S), Enclosure 4 provides details on surge and sustainment events (Numbered I through VI). An event may have known surge planning requirements, may be covered for surge, and may be needed in surge quantities during an actual contingency.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i">“Surge and sustainment planning requirements (S&amp;SPR,)”</em> or “go-to-war requirements,” are forecasted additive monthly wartime demand requirements derived from: (1) annual submissions of Other War Reserve Material Requirements (OWRMR) data from the Military Services; (2) analysis of supply chain risk assessment data and subsequent collaboration with appropriate DLA customers to define/validate additive demand during wartime; and (3) review and analysis of historical data focused on supply items with a weapon system essentiality code (WSEC) of 1, 5, 6 or 7 and Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) project coded requisitions. These requirements are the Services’ go-to-war items for contingency operations, national emergencies, or other readiness needs, when immediate availability of materials and speed of delivery are essential to support national security interests. DoDI 3110.06, War Reserve Materiel Policy, and DLM 4000.25-2, Military Standard Transaction Reporting &amp; Accountability Procedures (MILSTRAP), require identification of these go-to-war requirements to support national security interests of the United States.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i">“Surge quantity option”</em> means an increased quantity above and beyond peacetime demands expressed as a percentage or exact number with a sustainable accelerated delivery. This quantity is other than the MWR or D1-D6 schedule, and used for market ready, commercial, supplier part-numbered items (e.g., cataloged commercial items under a prime supplier arrangement) to support increased demands during contingency operations, national emergencies, or other readiness needs. Surge quantity option is calculated using appropriate demand data through market research, or determined by consulting the industrial specialist.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">
         <em class="ph i">“Unsupported item issue (UII)”</em> means surge requirements that cannot be met through peacetime inventory, normal peacetime contracting, alternative contract strategies, or a successful resolution using investment to an industrial capability issue (ICI). DLA is required to report a UII to the services for inclusion into their war reserve planning, such as when an investment to resolve an ICI exceeds cost of a Government “buy and hold” solution, or when stocking the item is counter to DoD war reserve policy.</p>

      <span class="ph autonumber">17.9302</span> Policy.</h3>
   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">(a) The primary mission of DLA is to support the warfighter in peacetime and wartime, to include smaller contingencies. The ability to surge, or ramp up quickly, and to sustain replenishment of wartime consumable items at an increased pace is critical to the execution of U.S. military strategy. The continuing emphasis by both DLA and suppliers to reduce inventory levels and DLA’s plan to rely on industrial capability directly impacts surge and sustainment coverage. S&amp;S capability is a primary consideration in all acquisition strategies and resource investments.</p>
      <p class="p">(b) Include surge and sustainment planning requirements (S&amp;SPR) in solicitations for indefinite-delivery term contracts for wartime critical materials. Acquisition planning must identify the most effective contract vehicle to ensure surge and sustainment coverage for surge events identified. Contracting officers must ensure go-to-war items identified during acquisition planning are included in solicitations for indefinite-delivery contracts, modifications adding items to a contract, or during option exercise.</p>

When a buffer is established, the contractor shall use the following process to submit requests for buffer material. A defense contractor (or sub-tier contractor supporting a prime contractor) with a current, active U.S. Government contract shall submit a valid request to use buffer material to the COR for the respective buffer material.

      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_17_9305__ZmGZVz">(1) The Warstopper program material buffer (Buffer) was created to decrease lead times for raw material to support defense contracts relating to military systems with a wartime requirement. The current material buffer suppliers and materials may be reviewed at <a class="xref" href="https://www.jccs.gov/wicap" target="_blank">
            <u class="ph u">https://www.jccs.gov/wicap</u>
         </a>.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_17_9305__mdVsgi">If the buffer material is not available or the material is inadequate to complete the requirement, the contractor must contact the contracting officer representative (COR) for guidance. When a buffer has been established, the following process must be used to submit requests for buffer material. A defense contractor (or sub-tier contractor supporting a prime contractor) with a current, active U.S. Government contract must submit a valid request to use a material buffer to the COR for the respective material buffer. The COR will review the submittal and approve or disapprove the request. -The request should include the following information:</p>
      <p class="p List3" id="DLAD_17_9305__muoXUr">(i) Requestor’s name;</p>
      <p class="p List3" id="DLAD_17_9305__aYxXgI">(ii) U.S. Government contract number;</p>

      <p class="p List3" id="DLAD_17_9305__JNpygE">(vii) Whether there is a pre-existing supply contract with the material buffer contractor.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_17_9305__zwNxPQ">(2) If no prior contractual relationship exists between the defense contractor requesting access to the material buffer and -the material buffer contractor, the material buffer contractor is authorized to enter into a contract – to provide material from the buffer – once a valid request has been approved by the COR. This action must be included in the monthly report submitted to the COR. When requests exceed the buffer’s maximum monthly material availability, the material supplier may negotiate phased delivery of material across the material monthly availability; or the Government COR may prioritize the release of the material at the Government’s discretion.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_17_9305__QiUiqc">(3) Contractors accessing the material buffer will be charged the material price identified in any pre-existing contract with the material buffer contractor. For those defense contractors not having a pre-existing contract with the material buffer contractor, they must be charged the standard (not spot market levels) pricing for the material. Contractors using the buffer are solely responsible for costs of using the buffer, and the Government has no liability either for these costs or for delays or other effects arising from the use of the buffer.</p>
      <p class="p Normal" id="DLAD_17_9305__EAKghS">(4) The buffer material provided is not Government furnished material, but is a normal vendor-to-vendor transaction with all applicable warranties and guarantees provided through the commercial transaction.</p>

   <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">(a) Tailored logistics support contracts are subject to continuous and rigorous management oversight as follows:</p>
      <p class="p List2">(1) The program manager or Integrated Support Team (IST) chief (i.e., one level above the contracting officer) for each tailored logistic support program (i.e., the team administering the program, for example, metals, MRO supplies, or special operations) must perform quarterly pricing reviews. Reviews will include a representative sample based on the total number of orders for that period. Upon completion of these reviews, the tailored logistics support program manager/IST chief must forward a report of the results, including any findings and corrective action plan, to the Director of Supplier Operations or designee for review and approval. A copy of the report must be kept as part of the contract file.</p>
      <p class="p List2">(2) Contract administration and compliance or contract review personnel at the procuring organization must perform contract audits of vendors’ compliance with non-pricing contract terms on at least a semi-annual basis. A copy of the report shall be provided to the contracting officer for review and action, as necessary, and inclusion in the contract file.</p>
      <p class="p">(b) The DLA Acquisition Contract and Pricing Compliance Division assesses performance of selected vendors. Assessments must examine the vendor’s adherence to the contract pricing methodology. Vendors are chosen for review based on risk assessment factors, including contract dollar value, previous annual audits, extent of competition, opportunities for refunds, reliance on the vendor’s purchasing system, and outside agency reports. The DLA Acquisition Contract and Pricing Compliance Division must furnish a copy of the assessments to the DLA Acquisition Director.</p>
      <p class="p">(c) Solicitations and contracts must include procurement note C08 when a tailored logistics support contract relies on the contractor’s purchasing system to verify that the contractor competed the items or services or to justify that prices are fair and reasonable.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">*****</p>
      <p class="p Normal">C08 Tailored Logistics Support Purchasing Reviews (FEB 2017)</p>
      <p class="p Normal">(1) From the commencement of performance of this contract until 3 years after the final contract payment, the contractor must allow the contracting officer, ACO, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), and any other duly authorized representative of the contracting officer access to all records and information pertaining to those items or services for which the Government is relying on the contractor’s purchasing system to determine that competition was obtained or to justify that prices are fair and reasonable. The contractor must maintain records subject to this clause for not less than 3 years after the contract final payment.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">(2) The contracting officer may conduct reviews of purchased items or services provided under this contract regardless of dollar value that meet the criteria in paragraph (1) to ascertain whether the contractor has obtained the best value. The contractor must obtain competition to the maximum extent practicable for all purchases.  Prior to purchasing any supplies or services, the contractor must solicit a competitive quotation from at least two independently-competing firms. For other than sole source items, the request for quotations must, to the maximum extent practical, solicit offers from different manufacturers or producers.  If the contractor is unable to obtain quotes for competing items from two or more independently-competing firms, the contractor must retain documentation supporting its rationale for selection of the suppliers solicited and selected and its determination that the price was fair and reasonable. The contractor is responsible for maintaining this documentation for all sole source/non-competitive actions. The following price reasonableness and documentation requirements are applicable to all purchases, regardless of dollar value:</p>
      <p class="p List3">(i) A price is reasonable if it does not exceed a price incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business. The contracting officer will examine the prices with particular care in connection with buys that may not be subject to effective competition restraints. The contractor’s price will not be presumed to be reasonable.  If an initial review of the facts results in a challenge of a specific price by the contracting officer or the contracting officer’s representative, the burden of proof must be upon the contractor to establish that the price is reasonable under the standards in FAR Subpart 15.4 and FAR 31.201-3.</p>
      <p class="p List3">(ii) The contractor must keep the documentation to a minimum, but must retain data supporting the purchases either by paper or electronically. At a minimum, price quotations and invoices must be retained.  Should the contractor receive an oral price quotation, the contractor must document who the supplier or subcontractor is by complete name, address, telephone number, price, terms and other conditions quoted by each vendor. Price quotes for supplies must be broken down by individual items, shipping costs, and any other included expenses. Price quotes for incidental services which are not pre- priced in the contract must include labor hours and costs or prices, as applicable, including the total price of the job, individual pricing for the portions of the work if applicable, materials, and all other elements of cost, overhead, and profit. This price breakdown documentation must be made for each subcontractor performing work on this contract.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">(3) When applicable, if the contractor is purchasing from subcontractors or other sources and receives a discount or rebates, the contractor must immediately pass these savings to the Government in the contract price and invoice for payment. The contractor is required to use diligence in the selection of the most economical method of delivery of the product or services by selecting a best value method of delivery based on the urgency and nature of the work or product required. When labor hours are involved in the work to be accomplished and the contractor has not already pre-priced the effort to use its own labor force, the contractor must provide the labor at rates required by the contract (for example, Service Contract Act or Davis-Bacon Act rates) or at rates based on competition if mandatory rates are not required by the contract.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">(4) If the contracting officer determines that the purchased product or service is unreasonably priced, the contractor must refund to the Government the amount the contracting officer determines is in excess of a reasonable price. The contracting officer must notify the contractor in writing in accordance with FAR 32.604 Demand for Payment, giving the basis for the determination and the amount to be refunded.
