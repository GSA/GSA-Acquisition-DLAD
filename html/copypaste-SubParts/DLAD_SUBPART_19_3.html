      <p class="p Normal">(1) In order to facilitate the use of electronic commerce/electronic data interchange while fulfilling the requirements of the small business program, the Government provides certain socioeconomic information in a coded format rather than a fill-in. Electronic commerce/electronic data interchange (EC/EDI) transactions are often reformatted in transmission. Using these codes prevents misinterpretations within the system and increases accuracy in socioeconomic program reporting.</p>

The offeror shall select the one alpha code from the following listing that represents the offeror’s business type. The offeror’s recording of its business type in this procurement note by means of an alpha code replaces the marking of the appropriate boxes in FAR 52.219-1(b). Penalties for misrepresentation of business status apply (see FAR 52.219-1, paragraph (d)(2)).</p>
