The contracting officer shall include PLT requirements in all solicitations and contracts if indicated in the material master. The product specialist will specify whether the contractor or the Government will conduct the test; and whether the testing site will be a contractor or Government facility. The contracting officer shall ensure the solicitation International Commerce Terminology Terms (Incoterms) match the production line item Incoterms, or the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) will not post the solicitation. Prior to award, the contracting officer shall confirm that PLT still applies; and if it does, change the PLT line item Incoterm to “F” in EBS, for inspection at source, acceptance at destination, and FOB destination.</p>

If PVT is invoked after contract award, a QALI will be created and the DCMA quality assurance representative (QAR) will notify the contractor that testing will be performed. The PVT testing will be performed at a Government-designated testing laboratory. </p>
      <p class="p">(a) The contractor shall not ship or deliver any material unless directed to do so in writing by the contracting officer or until notified of acceptable PVT results.</p>
      <p class="p">(b) PVT results will be provided in 20 working days after receipt at the Government testing facility, unless otherwise specified in writing by the Government.</p>
      <p class="p">(2) The QAR will select a random sample from the contractor’s production lot. Selected PVT samples are to be shipped by the contractor with a copy of the Department of Defense DD Form 250 and the completed DD Form 1222. The packaging will be marked “Product Verification Test Samples, Contract number __________, lot/item number ________."</p>
      <p class="p">(3) Test results will indicate one of the following:</p>
      <p class="p">(a) Samples that pass testing and are not destroyed during evaluation will be returned to the contractor at the Government's expense and will be included as part of the total contract quantity. The contractor and Government may agree to dispose of samples not destroyed when the cost of the item does not justify the shipping expense. Samples that pass testing and are not returned to the contractor will be considered part of the contract quantity for payment and delivery. The contractor will deliver the remaining lot quantity minus sample units.</p>
      <p class="p">(b) If samples fail testing, such failure will result in rejection of the entire contract lot from which the samples were taken. At the Government’s discretion, parts failing any test criteria may be retained and not be returned to the contractor.</p>
