      <p class="p Normal">(1) In accordance with FAR 52.216-27, Single or Multiple Awards, the Government may elect to award multiple contracts under this solicitation. The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with evaluation provisions in Section M of this solicitation. In the event of multiple awards, the Government will use the same evaluation criteria to determine which proposals represent the best value to the Government. The contracting officer has the discretion to determine the exact number of awards, considering the cost to the Government to administer multiple awards, the recurring nature of the requirement, the need to increase the active production base, and the benefits that may be achieved through continued competition.</p>

      <p class="p Normal">(a) In the event of multiple awards, the contracting officer will consider each awardee for placement of individual task or delivery orders unless an exception at FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies. However, awardees subject to testing and approval requirements (e.g., first article testing) are not eligible to receive orders until testing requirements are satisfactorily completed. Failure to successfully complete required testing will constitute grounds for contract termination for default by the Government.</p>
      <p class="p Normal">(b) Unless stated otherwise in the contract or in the request for quotes for task or delivery orders under this contract, the following evaluation process will be used in awarding task or delivery orders. The criteria used for evaluating offers for task or delivery orders under this contract are price, past performance, and delivery. Price is of ______ importance than or to the other factors combined. Past performance will include performance on orders previously placed under the contract and may include performance under other contracts. In evaluating performance under previous orders, the contracting officer will consider delivery, quality of supplies or services furnished, and success in implementing any socioeconomic support programs that may be applicable to the contract.</p>
