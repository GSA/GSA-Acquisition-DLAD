            furnish evidence to establish that there are no changes in the configuration of the
            part.</p>
        <p class="p List2">(4) For previously approved products, upon request of the contracting
            officer, the offeror must furnish the contract, solicitation, source approval request
            (SAR) package, or letter of approval under which the product was previously furnished or
            approved.</p>
        <p class="p">(h) Alternate offer data.</p>
        <p class="p List2">(1) The contracting officer may request drawings, specifications, or
            other data necessary to clearly describe the characteristics and features of an
            alternate offer. Data submitted shall cover design, materials, performance, function,
            interchangeability, inspection or testing criteria, and other characteristics of the
            offered product. The contracting officer may also request drawings and other data
            covering the design, materials, etc., of the exact product cited in the item description
            if the Agency does not possess data sufficient to evaluate the alternate product. The
            data must be submitted within 10 days, or as otherwise specified, or the offer will not
            be considered.</p>
        <p class="p List2">(2) If the alternate product is a reverse-engineered product, the
            offeror shall provide: technical documentation to establish that the offered item

            approved source or submission of samples having markings of an approved source); number
            of samples that were examined; the process/logic used; raw data (measurements, lab
            reports, test results) used to prepare drawings or specifications for the offered item;
            any additional evidence that indicates the reverse-engineered item will function
            properly in the end item; and any evidence that life cycle/reliability considerations
            have been analyzed.</p>
        <p class="p">(j) Evaluation of Alternate Offers.</p>
        <p class="p">If the solicitation does not provide for evaluation of alternate offers for the current
            procurement, the offeror may submit a request for evaluation of the alternate product’s
            technical acceptability for future procurements of the same item. The request for
            evaluation shall cite the national stock number (NSN) of the exact product and include
            the applicable level of technical data. The level of technical data that the Government
            has available for use to evaluate the acceptability of an alternate product offered, and
            the corresponding level of technical data that must be furnished with an offer of
            alternate product, will be identified in the item description and/or via correspondence
