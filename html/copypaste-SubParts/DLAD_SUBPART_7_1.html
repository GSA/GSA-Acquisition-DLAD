            or assisted acquisitions using non-DoD contract vehicles such as Federal Supply
            Schedules. Actions exempt from this requirement are:</p>
        <p class="p List2">(1) Individual orders (except orders greater than the SAT against
            non-DoD contracts) against contracts when the contract-level acquisition plan is
            adequate to cover all anticipated orders and the order is issued in strict compliance
            with the terms of the basic contract.</p>
        <p class="p List2">(2) A modification of the contract.</p>
        <p class="p List2">(3) Acquisition of replenishment parts, below DFARS 207.103
            thresholds (where applicable).</p>

            prior to solicitation issuance.</p>
        <p class="p">(d) Reserved.</p>
        <p class="p">(e) The level of detail provided in the acquisition plan should be commensurate with the

            than full and open competition (see FAR 6.301 and FAR 6.304) when submitted to the
            procuring organization competition advocate (COMPAD). Procuring organization COMPADs
