      <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DLAD/DLAD_Fixed/dita/7.102.ditap:1;7:10">(a) Written acquisition plans are required for all acquisitions expected to exceed the
            simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), including those accomplished by means of direct
            or assisted acquisitions using non-DoD contract vehicles such as Federal Supply
            Schedules. Actions exempt from this requirement are:</p>
      <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DLAD/DLAD_Fixed/dita/7.102.ditap:2;11:30 List2">(1) Individual orders (except orders greater than the SAT against
            non-DoD contracts) against contracts when the contract-level acquisition plan is
            adequate to cover all anticipated orders and the order is issued in strict compliance
            with the terms of the basic contract.</p>
      <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DLAD/DLAD_Fixed/dita/7.102.ditap:3;15:30 List2">(2) A modification of the contract.</p>

            complexity and dollar value of the acquisition.</p>

            than full and open competition (see FAR 6.301 and FAR 6.304) when submitted to the
            procuring organization competition advocate (COMPAD). Procuring organization COMPADs
