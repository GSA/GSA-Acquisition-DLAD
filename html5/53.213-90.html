      <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DLAD/DLAD_Fixed/dita/53.213-90.ditap:2;8:10">(a) General. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Form 470 is a cut sheet form and is designed to be used by the vendor as an acknowledgment of a call, notice of shipment, packing list, and invoice. This form eliminates the need for preparation, by the Contractor, of separate forms for these purposes. Also, Government personnel requiring information on these forms will receive it on a standard format.</p>
      <p class="p file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/DLAD/DLAD_Fixed/dita/53.213-90.ditap:3;9:10">(b) Procedure. A supply of the forms may be provided by the contracting office to each Contractor who has entered into a BPA with the center. Upon the placing of a call, the Contractor may be required to complete the BPA delivery ticket based on information contained in the written or oral call in accordance with detailed instructions to be provided by the contracting office.</p>
