When the Government needs to inspect before tender or deviate in any other way from FAR 52.212-4(a) with regard to quality assurance, tailor the solicitation/contract by attaching an addendum (reference FAR 12.302(d)). If the tailoring invokes contract terms and conditions that are consistent with customary commercial practice, a waiver is not required (reference FAR 12.302(c)); although an addendum is necessary to change the terms of the solicitation/contract. If FAR 52.212-4 is incorporated in the solicitation or contract reference with no addendum, the Government has only the rights explicitly stated in FAR 52.212-4(a).</p>
