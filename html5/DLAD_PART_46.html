The product specialist will review the ESA testing requirements for completeness, accuracy, and applicability; coordinate any changes with the ESA; and enter the testing requirements in the material master. The contracting officer shall include PLT requirements in all solicitations and contracts if indicated in the material master. The product specialist will specify whether the contractor or the Government will conduct the test; and whether the testing site will be a contractor or Government facility. The contracting officer shall ensure the solicitation International Commerce Terminology Terms (Incoterms) match the production line item Incoterms, or the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) will not post the solicitation. Prior to award, the contracting officer shall confirm that PLT still applies; and if it does, change the PLT line item Incoterm to “F” in EBS, for inspection at source, acceptance at destination, and FOB destination.</p>
