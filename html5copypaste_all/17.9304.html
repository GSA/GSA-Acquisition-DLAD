When a buffer is established, the contractor shall use the following process to submit requests for buffer material. A defense contractor (or sub-tier contractor supporting a prime contractor) with a current, active U.S. Government contract shall submit a valid request to use buffer material to the COR for the respective buffer material. The COR will review the submittal and approve or disapprove the request. The contractor shall include the following information in the request:</p>

The CAP must demonstrate (i) the offeror’s ability to provide the full S&amp;S quantity and meet the delivery requirements as specified in the solicitation; (ii) the technical merits of the proposed solutions to any identified shortfalls in S&amp;S quantity and/or delivery requirements; and (iii) the ability to achieve the solutions without Government investment.
