        <p class="p">H15 Transporter proof of delivery (TPD) (JAN 2021)</p>
        <p class="p">(a) Definition.<em class="ph i"> </em>As used in this procurement note, transporter proof of delivery
            (TPD) means a commercial document that is generated by the Contractor and/or the
            Contractor’s transporter of supplies and that is signed by the Government customer in
            order to document delivery of supplies under this contract/order. Examples of TPD are
            United Parcel Service (UPS) or Federal Express (FEDEX) delivery tracking reports. TPD
            documentation must include a customer signature, or visibility of the name of the
            customer who signed.</p>
        <p class="p">(b) When this procurement note is included in the contract or order, the Government may
            use TPD, in combination with adequate Contractor documentation cross-referencing the TPD
            to the specific supplies provided, as a basis for accepting the supplies. TPD with
            adequate supporting documentation satisfies the receipt report requirement and, coupled
            with acceptance, allows the Government to initiate the payment process, if all other
            applicable payment conditions are satisfied.</p>
        <p class="p">(c) To facilitate the payment process, the Government will initiate a request for the
            Contractor to provide TPD when the customer has not provided receipt acknowledgement to
            the buying activity. If TPD is requested and the Contractor agrees to provide it, the
            documentation must include the customer signature, or visibility of the name of the
            customer who signed, and as much of the following information as possible:</p>

            blanket purchase agreement, the Contractor shall:</p>
        <p class="p List3">(i) Assume all responsibility and risk of loss for supplies not
            received at destination, damaged in transit, or not conforming to purchase requirements;
            and</p>

            Contractor’s expense, if instructed to do so by the Contracting Officer within 180 days
